Doctor's Appointment Calender
This website is build only for one user so I don't use authentication for it. For multiple user it can be updated.
I used Tailwind and DaisyUI to build this website. Though I make it responsive but it will create some problem in the small device as the calender has 7 rows. For using tailwind and DaisyUI I used CDN, so no need to install something for run this project. For run this project for the first time, need to create an .env file and update the database name and then use command "php artisan migrate" and to run this project you need to run "php artisan serve".
